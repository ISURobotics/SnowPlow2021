This is where we're putting all of our test and prototype scripts that might be helpful but aren't used in the final product.
Nothing in here should need to be uploaded for the competition.
I grouped them in folders by system that they test.

I wouldn't advise deleting much of anything here, in case these tests turn out to be useful later.
